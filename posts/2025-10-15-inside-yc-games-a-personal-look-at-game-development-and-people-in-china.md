During a recent trip to Shanghai, China, I had the unique opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes look at the country's vibrant video game industry. I visited the offices of YC Games, a prominent game development and publishing company, and the CEO and co-founder, Zhao Qianli, also happens to be my wife's uncle.

He graciously shared his time and insights, and our conversation delved into the nuances of making games for the Chinese market and the unique people-related challenges he faces. It was a fascinating glimpse into the dynamic and rapidly evolving world of Chinese gaming.



### Crafting Worlds at YC Games

YC Games is a bustling studio with roughly 200 employees, a creative hub dedicated to building immersive worlds. Uncle Zhao explained that his teams develop a variety of games, mostly set in rich fantasy or medieval settings. What I found particularly interesting is their technical approach; they're masters of their craft, utilizing both well-known commercial engines like Unreal or Unity, as well as their own proprietary game engines to bring their visions to life. This flexibility allows them to create truly unique gameplay experiences tailored to their audience.



### The People Behind the Pixels: A Unique HR Landscape

Beyond the creative process, I was keen to understand the business and management side of things. I sat down with Uncle Zhao and a key member of his administrative team, who handles their human resources. Our discussion quickly turned to the topic of employee management, which is surprisingly different from what we're used to in Europe.

One of the most eye-opening insights was about Chinese labor law. While it's a common perception that employee benefits in China may not be as comprehensive as in many European countries, what's less known is how well-protected employees are against termination. Uncle Zhao explained that the legal framework makes it quite difficult to let staff go.

This creates a unique management challenge. How do you motivate and maintain high performance in a large, creative team when the usual "stick" of potential dismissal is largely off the table? For YC Games, the focus shifts entirely to the "carrot." They have to build a strong, positive company culture, offer compelling career development paths, and ensure their team members feel valued and engaged in their work. It's a management style built on inspiration rather than pressure, which was fascinating to learn about.

My visit to YC Games was more than just a family catch-up; it was a deep dive into an industry powerhouse. A huge thank you to my wife's uncle, Zhao Qianli, and his team for their incredible hospitality and for sharing their world with me.
